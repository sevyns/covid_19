# COVID 19 Analysis

This repository contains work related to reporting and analysis of data collected for COVID-19.

## Files:

* COVID-19 Data Analysis.ipynb - Juypter Notebook containing my notes.
* Covid_19 Analysis.pbit - Power BI template file for recreating the dashboard I'm using. This sources data directly from Johns-Hopkins University's github hosted content.
* Covid_19 Analysis.pbix - Power BI solution (**DEPRICATED**). Will be removing, all future Power BI edits will be commited against the template file. This should prevent any 'Updated data' commits.
* CSV_ETL.py - Python script for extracting, transforming, and loading the flat files from Johns-Hopkins github. The Power BI solution is not dependent upon this; if you'd rather just grab a clean flat file to examine feel free to use this.
